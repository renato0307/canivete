			Calculates compound interests.
	
			The formula for compound interests is a = p*((1+r/n)^(n * t))
			With different periodic payments an extra is needed:
				a_series = m * (y/n) {[(1 + r/n)^(n * t) - 1] / (r/n)}
				total = a + a_series
	
			Where:
				a = the future value of the investment/loan, including interest
				p = the principal investment amount (the initial deposit or loan amount)
				r = the annual interest rate (decimal)
				n = the number of times that interest is compounded per unit t
				t = the time the money is invested or borrowed for
				m = the regular contribution
				y = regular contributions in the compounded period
